# Smart Notification Toast System
### 🎯 Goal  
Build a smart notification toast system that displays temporary messages on a webpage — just like modern web apps (e.g., Gmail, Trello, or Slack).

### The notification should:

1. Appear with a message (e.g., “ ✅ Profile updated successfully”)
2. Auto-hide after a few seconds using setTimeout().
3. Allow manual dismissal (click “×” to close early).
4. Optionally, stack multiple toasts if triggered quickly.

### 💡Learning
1. How to manage timed UI events with setTimeout().
2. Handling race conditions between timeouts and user actions
3. Creating modular reusable functions in front-end development
4. Adding polish with smooth transitions
