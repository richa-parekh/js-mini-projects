### The `<template>` tag - A core HTML Feature That Simplified JS
- It defines a reusable block of markup that is not rendered when the page loads.
- Its content stays inactive (not part of the live DOM) until you explicitly use JavaScript to clone and insert it.
- It’s mainly used for creating dynamic UI elements like chat bubbles, cards, lists, modals, or components that repeat with different data.
